This project aims to create an API wrapper for Helldivers 2.<br />
I have been playing the game a lot since it is out, and I wanted to try and build something around it.<br />

Currently, there is no way to get access to player data, but we're not done!

## Features

- [X] Get war season
- [X] Get war info
- [X] Get war news feed
- [ ] Player endpoints
- [ ] Global statistics endpoints
